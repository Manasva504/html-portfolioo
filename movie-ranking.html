<h1>The Best Movies According to Manasva</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Dark Knight</h3>
<p>This is my favourite movie. I love the action and thrill in this one.</p>
<h3>Interstellar </h3>
<p>Really cool sci-fi movie. Which really dives into time dilation and gives us a glimpse of what would happen if there was a black hole and time dilation.</p>
<h3>spider man </h3>
<p>I really love the storyline of this one nd the chemistry of peter and gwen was just lovely.</p>
